// TicTacToe.cpp
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This file is intentionally *full of comments* and gentle TODOs that guide you
// through wiring up a complete Tic‑Tac‑Toe implementation using the game engine’s
// Bit / BitHolder grid system.
//
// Rules recap:
//  - Two players place X / O on a 3x3 grid.
//  - Players take turns; you can only place into an empty square.
//  - First player to get three-in-a-row (row, column, or diagonal) wins.
//  - If all 9 squares are filled and nobody wins, it’s a draw.
//
// Notes about the provided engine types you'll use here:
//  - Bit              : a visual piece (sprite) that belongs to a Player
//  - BitHolder        : a square on the board that can hold at most one Bit
//  - Player           : the engine’s player object (you can ask who owns a Bit)
//  - Game options     : let the mouse know the grid is 3x3 (rowX, rowY)
//  - Helpers you’ll see used: setNumberOfPlayers, getPlayerAt, startGame, etc.
//
// I’ve already fully implemented PieceForPlayer() for you. Please leave that as‑is.
// The rest of the routines are written as “comment-first” TODOs for you to complete.
